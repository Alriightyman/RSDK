Animation Flag Notes:

Default Behaviour: No Rotation

Full Engine Rotation: Once the detected angle is high enough (about 45 degrees), Rotate the player based on the angle of the ground they are on (360 Degrees)

45 Degree Engine Rotation: Once the detected angle is high enough (about 45 degrees), Rotate the player based on the angle of the ground they are on BUT only if its a multiple of 45 degrees

Static Rotation Using Extra Frames: Once the detected angle is high enough (about 45 degrees), Rotate the player based on the angle of the ground they are 
on using the extra frames (look at sonic CD/ Sonic 1/ Sonic 2 animations to see what I mean)

1/2 Engine Rotation: Flips the player when detected angle is above 90 degrees & below 270 degrees

90 Degree Engine Rotation: Once the detected angle is high enough (about 45 degrees), Rotate the player based on the angle of the ground they are on BUT only if its a multiple of 90 degrees

135/225 degree Rotation: Rotates the sprite about 135 degrees when going left and about 225 degrees when going right, probably ment for one specific object

Just 135 degree Rotation: Same as "135/225 degree Rotation" but doesnt flip the player when going left, so the player is always rotated at an angle of 135 degrees

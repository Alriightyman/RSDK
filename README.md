# RSDK reverse and tools

# Original ReadME Section

This is a repository where I am hosting tools and reverse engineering notes from RSDK (Retro-SDK) development kit developed by Christian Whitehead.

RSDK has 5 versions:
* RSDKvRS: Retro Sonic
* RSDKv1: Sonic Nexus
* RSDKv2: Sonic CD (2011)
* RSDKvB: Sonic the Hedgehog 1 and Sonic the Hedgehog 2 remakes
* RSDKv4: Sonic 3K (unreleased, so this is just an assumption, it very well could've been the same as vB)
* RSDKv5: Sonic Mania

The repository supports the Animation Systems of all 5 versions of the RSDK. The tool used to view and edit the animation of those versions is called RSDK Animation Editor.

During 2012 I created a program to disassemble the bytecode used by RSDKv3. It is old, buggy and released only because it was directly requested. It is no longer maintained and I am uploading it for research purpose only.

# Thanks:
- Xeeynamo - For making the Sonic Mania Animation Editor and RSDKv2/RSDKvB and RSDKv5 libaries
- Nextvolume/tails92 - For Making TaxAni, which I used as a "guide" for the RSDKvRS and RSDKv1 libaries
